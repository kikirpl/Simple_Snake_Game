Steps to Run Python Code in Visual Studio Code:

Install the Python Extension: Open VS Code, go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for "Python", and install the extension by Microsoft.
Create a New Python File: Create a new file with a .py extension (e.g., hello.py).
Write Your Python Code: Write your Python code in the file.
Run the Code:
Use the Terminal: Open the integrated terminal (Ctrl+), navigate to your project directory, and runpython hello.py`.
Use the Run Button: Right-click in the editor and select "Run Python File in Terminal".
Use the Debugger: Set breakpoints and use the debug console.
Additional Tips:

Choose a Python Interpreter: If you have multiple Python versions, select the desired one in the bottom left corner of VS Code.
Configure a Linter: Use a linter like Pylint or Flake8 to check your code for errors.
Create a Virtual Environment: Isolate project dependencies using a virtual environment.
In essence:

Install the Python extension in VS Code.
Create a Python file.
Write your code.
Run the code using the terminal, a button, or the debugger.
